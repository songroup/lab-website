Chang Yun Son is an assistant professor in the Department of Chemistry at SNU. Hereceived his B.S. and M.S. in chemistry from Seoul National University, Ph.D. in chemistry fromUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison in 2017, and worked as postdoctoral researcher at Caltech before joining POSTECH in 2020. In the Summer of 2024, he moved his research group to Seoul National University. His current interests focus on the development and application ofmultiscale simulation models for highly charged soft materials systems, including ionic liquids,polymer electrolytes, biological membranes, and biomacromolecules.

The overall goal of research in our group will be to build a versatile simulation framework for charged interfaces to aid the rational design of functional energy / bio soft materials.

Our approach will involve developing truly predictive first-principles force fields, applying state-of-the-art molecular simulation techniques to overcome the space-time limitation of current simulation methods, as well as using multi-scale simulation methods and theoretical tools to study syntehtic and biological macromolecules.

We use machine-learning / molecular simulation packages as well as develop new simulation methods & tools / analyze large set of data and construct new ways to understand the mechanisms of chemical processes through information obtained from our models.

We are computational chemistry lab at SNU Department of Chemistry.

Our lab develops molecular simulations to solve problems that are critical in energy / bio applications. We use & develop statistical mechanics / molecular dynamics / coarse-grained methods / machine-learning / big data analysis to understand the mechanisms of chemical processes and help designing new functional materials.

<!-- # Son Research Lab -->

Our lab is a collective of molecular simulation research investigators with an interest in studying the energy/bio soft materials system. Molecular simulation is performed to quantitatively analyzing the structure, dynamics, thermody-namics and reaction kinetics of several systems from the physical models given. Our mission is not only to provide microscopic understanding of various molecular-level phenomena, but also to develop the advanced computational techniques / algorithms to properly capture the underlying physics. We have strong expertise in genome profiling analysis, a proven track record on the development of high-throughput laboratory and analytical pipelines (bioinformatics and statistical), and integrating large and complex genomic datasets. We have formed a strong network of research and clinical collaborations to pursue innovative studies in cancer research.

We are computational chemistry lab at SNU Department of Chemistry.

Our lab develops molecular simulations to solve problems that are critical in energy / bio applications. We use & develop statistical mechanics / molecular dynamics / coarse-grained methods / machine-learning / big data analysis to understand the mechanisms of chemical processes and help designing new functional materials.
